## Synopsis

This is a teleport system for Oculus Based VR Headsets ( Oculus Rift or Gear VR ) made with Unity. If you look to the floor a mark will appear and 
when you tap a touch control you will be teleported to the mark.

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Motivation

The teleport system is one of the best ways to move in a VR environment avoiding motion sickness.
